🛠️ Steps Followed
1️⃣ Data Loading and Exploration
Loaded dataset using pandas.

Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

Visualized data distributions and relationships.

2️⃣ Data Preprocessing
Handled missing values.

Converted categorical variables using encoding.

Scaled/standardized numerical features.

3️⃣ Model Building
Split the dataset into train and test sets.

Implemented multiple classification algorithms:

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree Classifier

Random Forest Classifier

(Add others if used)

4️⃣ Model Evaluation
Evaluated models using:

Accuracy Score

Confusion Matrix

Classification Report

ROC-AUC Curve (if applicable)

Selected the best-performing model.
