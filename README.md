## ⚙️ Technologies Used

* Python 🐍
* Jupyter Notebook 📓
* Libraries:

  * pandas
  * numpy
  * matplotlib / seaborn (for visualization)
  * scikit-learn (for modeling)

## 🛠️ Steps Followed

### 1️⃣ Data Loading and Exploration

* Loaded dataset using pandas.
* Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
* Visualized data distributions and relationships.

### 2️⃣ Data Preprocessing

* Handled missing values.
* Converted categorical variables using encoding.
* Scaled/standardized numerical features.

### 3️⃣ Model Building

* Split the dataset into train and test sets.
* Implemented multiple classification algorithms:

  * Logistic Regression
  * Decision Tree Classifier
  * Random Forest Classifier
  * (Add others if used)

### 4️⃣ Model Evaluation

* Evaluated models using:

  * Accuracy Score
  * Confusion Matrix
  * Classification Report
  * ROC-AUC Curve (if applicable)
* Selected the best-performing model.
